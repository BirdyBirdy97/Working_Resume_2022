<!----------------------------------------------------------------------- Main Content ----------------------------------------------------------------------->

        <div id="main-content">
            <p id="greeting">I'm a self-taught Junior Developer looking to break into the industry with roughly three years total programming experience, an 
                aptitude for learning, and a passion for puzzles. Additionally, I have experience in marketing, film development, and graphics design and have won a
                marketing competition with my groups' designs. My biggest projects at the moment are a task list for people with executive dysfunction (Python), a 
                few small arcade-style games (mostly re-creations, Python), and a complete portfolio website (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). I am willing to relocate if 
                need be, but would prefer semi or total remote work.</p>
