                <h4 class="schools-xp">Dundalk Esso On The Run</h4>
                <p class="degree">Gas Station Attendant, 2020-2021, 2022-present</p>
                <p>Left for university and have since returned. Main duties include serving customers using a POS system and cash, ensuring there aren't
                    any drive-offs, keeping the shelves, cooler, smokes, and lotto stocked, keeping the store clean, and dealing with difficult situations 
                    (customers, fires, power-outages...)
                </p>

                <h4 class="schools-xp">Diabetes Canada</h4>
                <p class="degree">Remote Call Centre Agent, 2022</p>
                <p>Recieved cold-calls through a VOIP phone, asked if the person would like to donate items, then sorted their call depending on the
                    answer and wrote any necessary notes in their file. Consistantly made a heafty bonus each month due to performance without any prior
                    call centre experience.

                    and food efficiently, kept ingredients and materials stocked, processed employee discounts, and accurately deviated from the recipes
                    when substitutions were requested, regardless of how complex.
