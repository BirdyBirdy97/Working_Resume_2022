Hello, welcome to my resume website! I'm currently working on a much bigger website that will include a portfolio, 
but for now I'll be using this. A PDF copy of the webview has been uploaded to my Linkedin. 

If you have any suggestions as to how I could improve my resume, please let me know! I'm currently trying to get
my first job in the programming industry and would appreciate any pointers.
